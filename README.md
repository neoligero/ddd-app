# ddd-app

## Motivation
The application has been develop base on Express and following new patterns and methologies like DDD or TDD.
The implementation is not fully completed and some classes or test are just mocked or bypassed.

## Run the application
If you dont have mongo installed in your system use the docker compose file, otherwise you can jump to the second command.
 `$ docker-compose up`
 `$ yarn install & yarn start:dev`

## Run test
After setup the database you can launch you test with
`$ yarn test`

## Docs
I normally like to use Swagger in my projects, but because of the lack of time, I just attached a litte Postman collection in the root directory.
